// Components rules consist of reusable, discrete UI elements; components
// should comprise the bulk of Drupal’s CSS. It should be designed to exist
// as a standalone component. Components can easily be moved to different
// parts of the layout without breaking.

// Import Sass variables, functions, mixins and placeholders.

// This file is compiled separately so we can pull in config dependencies
// above while also maintaining Drupal's SMACSS structure.
